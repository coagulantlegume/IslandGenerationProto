Short Description:
    This program is an experiment in using layered simplex noise to generate floating island meshes. The current version allows the user to specify the
seed, scale, and influence of three layers of noise on a final mesh, as well as the max height, falloff of height in relation to distance from center of island,
cutoff height for edges of mesh, and whether the mesh is rendered as flat shaded or wireframe.

How to use:
    Camera Controls:
            Left click and drag to orbit 
            Scroll wheel to zoom 
            Right click and drag to translate

    Noise parameters:
            Seed - A random string that works as the seed for the given noise layer.
            Zoom - How concentrated the detail of noise on the given layer is.
            Influence - How prominent the given noise layer is in the final height of the mesh.
    
    Height parameters:
            Top Height - The maximum height of any point on the island.
            Height Falloff - Exponent value of how quickly the height diminishes in relation to distance from center.
            Cutoff - Proximity to zero height that removes a vertex in order to create island shape.
    
    Wireframe: Whether mesh is drawn as flat shading solid or wireframe.

    Friends: Friends :)
             (migrated over and cleaned up particle effect from one of my previous projects, replicates the flocking behavior in the game this demo's logic
              will be used for)
